you can rearrange the arguments as long as they are assigned properly

example: sayHello(firstName, lastName)
         sayHello(lastName = 'Joe', firstName = 'Billy')


y : list   # defining that y (a variable) is a list


n0 : float, n1 : float       # defining that n0 and n1 must be a float

Json is newer than XML and better in most ways

RSS = XML feeds

OMDb API (on the internet)   -- can search of different Json files on movies

[] = list

{} = dictionary
